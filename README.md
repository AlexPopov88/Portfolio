# Alex's Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Alex, and Iâ€™m embarking on an exciting journey in Data Analytics. This repository showcases my projects, case studies, and other work that reflect my skills and progress in data analysis tools.

# About Me
I have over 10 years of experience as an Analyst in the financial sector. My expertise lies in SQL, where I have designed and managed MS SQL Server databases, integrated data from multiple sources, and developed tables, stored procedures, and views to support department's reporting systems. Additionally, I designed and maintained an ALM (Asset and Liability Management) system, enabling operational control over the bankâ€™s liquidity. In recent years, I expanded my skill set by learning Python and incorporating it into my workflow to enhance data processing and automation. I currently work as an Analyst, where I design data marts, automate business processes, and support business goals through data-driven insights. My current competencies include PL/SQL, Python, and Microsoft Excel. 

# Transition to Data Analytics
Driven by my passion for data, I decided to take the next step in my career and transition into Data Analytics. To strengthen my knowledge, I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera, where I gained hands-on experience with the key phases of the data analysis process.

# What You'll Find Here
My portfolio begins with case studies from the Google Data Analytics course, showcasing my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data. Moving forward, I will be adding more projects that apply advanced SQL, Python, and BI tools to solve real-world data problems.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to explore my projects, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss data, analytics, or potential collaborations.
