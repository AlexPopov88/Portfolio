# Alex's Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio on GitHub. My name is Alex and I'm starting my path in Data Analysis. Here is a collection of my projects, case studies and other files that can demonstrate my skills and my progress in Data Analytics tools.

A few words about myself: I've been working in Treasury in the Bank for 10 years as Analyst. I have advanced skills in SQL, because my main responsobilities were designing MS SQL Server, collecting data from different sources, creating tables, stored procedures and view in order to create and maintain Treasury reporting system. I also developed and maintained the ALM system that enabled operational control of the Bankâ€™s liquidity. Last few years I started to learn Python and implemented it into my work. 

Recently I've decided to make a new step in my career. And I really excited about trying myself in Data Analysis. I've finished a course on Coursera and received Google Data Analytics Certificate. I learned a lot of interesting aspects of being Data Analyst and about main steps of Data Analysis process. My first projects in this portfolio will be case studies from this course.
